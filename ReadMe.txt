Purpose:

To run programs automatically at a scheduled time either
re-occurringly on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, or on a
once-only run.

-------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------

Why I wrote this:

To build it!  Why else?  Really, I needed something for work,
and I wanted to write one.  I know that there are packages out
there that do the same, and maybe even better.  I wrote this 
to do it, and to share it with others -- free. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------

Warranty of use:

I take no responsibility for any damages done by using this
application.  This is an "AS-IS" application, and use at your
own risk.

-------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------

Distribution:

This is FREEWARE.  

You may make as many copies as you like.

   wish to schedule

This assumes you are able to use Command-Line settings to
access this feature.  If so, this feature will allow you to
run the event in Setup Mode.

Further Notes:

I hope that this program is useful to those that either needed
an application like this, wanted to learn how to create an
automated event scheduler, or for any other reason.

Please feel free to send any questions, concerns, bugs, or 
likewise to me pertaining to this program:

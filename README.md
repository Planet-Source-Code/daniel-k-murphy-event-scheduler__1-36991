### Description

Application scheduled running. To run any application at a given hour on a given date, once a month, once a week, or once a day without having to have user input.
 
### More Info
 
None code-wise.

Windows API knowledge is preferable. Must know VB fluently, however, abundant comments are throught-out the code. References to AutoBot, whom wrote the SysTray module, are included for his work. All other code is my original work.
